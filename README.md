This Unity script makes it easier to create quality ChilloutVR avatars by allowing you to utilize as many controllers as you want. This allows you to generalize your Animator logic and easily share it between multiple avatars, without the need to manually merge controllers per avatar.

You can manually compile the controllers utilizing the "Compile Controllers" button. The controllers will automatically compile on CCK Upload.
